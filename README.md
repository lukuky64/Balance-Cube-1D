# Balance-Cube-1D
This project implements a 6-DOF IMU (with the potential addition of an optical rotary encoder) and active current sensing and magnetic encoding of a BLDC motor to perform closed-loop feedback control, solving an inverted pendulum problem. This device utilises a custom PCB, featuring a dual-core 240MHz ESP32-S3, which is leveraged through a FreeRTOS implementation for multithreaded operations. This is all powered via a USB-C port with onboard power delivery control for seamless use.
