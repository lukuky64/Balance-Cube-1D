# Balance-Cube-1D
This project implements IMU sensor fusion, system modelling and closed loop feedback to balance a cube on its corner. This device uses a custom made PCB which implements an ESP32-S3, BLDC motor with torque control, 6-axis IMU, all powered via a USB-C with onboard power delivery control.
