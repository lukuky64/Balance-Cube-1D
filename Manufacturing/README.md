# Design notes for next PCB iteration:

- Don't put traces on the same side (especially so close) as traces. If someone misses with their screwdriver, it could easily slice a trace.
- Forgot to place automatic stitching vias over board.
- Find how to ensure complex board cutout is created (was fine for my case but i had to specifically ask for them to ensure this).
- Holes on pads for wires are a bit small (BLDC, SERVO, OPT ENC).
- Now that I have a reference, adjust mounting hole sizes for a looser fit.
