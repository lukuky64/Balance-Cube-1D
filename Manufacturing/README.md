# Design notes for next PCB iterations:

- Don't put traces on the same side (especially so close) as traces. If someone misses with their screwdriver, it could easily slice a trace.
- Forgot to place automatic stitching vias over board.
- Find how to ensure complex board cutout is created (was fine for my case but i had to specifically ask for them to ensure this).
- Holes on pads for wires are a bit small (BLDC, SERVO, OPT ENC).
- Now that I have a reference, adjust mounting hole sizes for a looser fit.
- Select a thicker PCB
- Change boot and reset buttons to something more clickable. Space them apart better so they can both be clicked easily. Also relocate the buttons to an edge maybe.

# Design notes for next structural iterations:

### Legs:
  - Design sharper corner
  - Look at different materials or some coating, doesn't work well on smooth surface. Needs more grip

### Servo braking:
  - Should I actually implement it now that I know everything else works

### Encoder attachment
  - first iteration is designed, just need to print it, and then actually program it
