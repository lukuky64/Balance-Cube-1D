Ideas:
- Logging can cause delays. Use a circular buffer for data collection and perform batch writes to the SD card to minimise blocking times.
- Consider fusing IMU and optical/magnetic encoder data using a complementary or Kalman filter to improve angle estimation accuracy.
- Integrate low-power modes for non-critical tasks to maximise energy efficiency.
